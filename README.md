# Card-Game-WAR-
Real-Time Computer Vision Card Game (“War”)
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Computer Vision Algorithms
- Developed an interactive Augmented Reality (AR) style game detecting physical playing cards in
real-time to battle CPU opponents.
- Implemented efficient image processing using Canny Edge Detection, Perspective Transforms,
and Corner Template Matching to identify card ranks with high speed.

- Engineered a custom graphical interface solely using OpenCV drawing primitives and a stability
algorithm to handle motion noise/flickering.
